# CNVkit - single sample (DNAnexus Platform App)

Run the CNVkit pipeline to call copy number variants.

This is the source code for an app that runs on the DNAnexus Platform.
For more information about how to run or modify it, see
https://wiki.dnanexus.com/.
<!-- /dx-header -->

Run the CNVkit pipeline in "batch" mode:

- Use a BED file of baited regions and 0 or more normal samples to construct a
  copy number reference; or
- Use a pre-built copy number reference file to call CNVs from one or more BAM
  files; or
- Both.
