Helper scripts not used in the built app's execution on DNAnexus.

dx-clone-asset.py:
    Brett Hannigan's script to ease the process of making a Docker image
    asset available in multiple regions.

    First, create an asset with `dx-docker create-asset`. Then, run this
    script::

        dx-clone-asset.py --record <asset record-id> --regions [list of regions to clone to...]

    It will then copy the asset to each of the regions specified.

    You of course need a project in that region to actually clone it into, so the
    first time you run the script, it will create a new project called "DNAnexus
    Assets for <region>". All subsequent runs will place their new assets in
    those projects as well.

    At the end of running this script, it will print out each region requested
    and the record-id  for that region.  If one of the clone jobs was
    unsuccessful, it will just print "Failed" for that region.
